# APL Head Tracker

## A basic inexpensive head tracker based on the GY-521/MPU6050 sensor

This head tracker is designed to connect to a computer through a serial port, using a USB cable. This tracker is however designed to work best with the APL OSC bridge available here:

Fully assembled head trackers can be purchased from here: 

If you feel like this may be a good DIY project, kits including all the necessary parts and soldering instructions can be purchased from here:

However, if you feel really adventurous, you can build the entire head tracker from scratch as follows:

### Requirements:
- Arduino Nano V3 - (recommended the mini-usb version). 
- GY-521/MPU6050 IMU 
- APL tracker PCB shield, available from here: Alternatively GRBL or SVG files can be found here for home-manufacturing of the PCB shield. 
- Enclosure, available here: Alternatively, STL or 3MF files can be found here for home-printing of the enclosures. You can choose between a filleted-edge version or a chamfered-edge version which may print better on FDM 3D printers.
